# What are Data Structures?

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and efficiently managing data for applications like large databases and internet indexing services. Critical to programming, they're used across various software systems, including web development, operating systems, and image editing. Common types include arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs, each chosen based on specific needs dictated by abstract data types (ADTs).

The choice of a data structure significantly impacts a program's performance, affecting both the speed of operations and memory usage. For example, trees are crucial for database management and file systems, while graphs are essential for networking and social media algorithms. This choice is also vital for the algorithm-data structure interplay, where the efficiency of algorithms often depends on the appropriate use of data structures.

Furthermore, understanding the differences between abstract data types and data structures—where ADTs define the operations on data, and data structures implement these operations—is essential for effective programming. Recent advances continue to expand the possibilities for data management, addressing challenges in big data and machine learning with innovative solutions.
